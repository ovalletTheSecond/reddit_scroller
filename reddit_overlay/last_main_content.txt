      "contentHtml": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><em>Siddhartha</em> by Hermann Hesse is a novella chronicling the spiritual journey of a man named Siddhartha (note, not <em>the</em> Siddhartha) as he leaves his family in search of spiritual enlightenment.</p> <p>I read a comment online awhile back saying something along the line of &quot;<em>Siddhartha</em> is a book one should read when they&#39;re seventeen, and only when they&#39;re seventeen.&quot; I also recall a comment that called Hermann Hesse &quot;The German Paulo Coelho&quot;. Though I have not read <em>The Alchemist</em>, I am familiar with its reputation, so I probably had some bias going into the book.</p> <p>I found the philosophy and spirituality shallow at first and Siddhartha kind of gave off a podcast bro vibe. About halfway through the book someone points out to Siddhartha that things work out in his favor because of his privileges, and he&#39;s like, &quot;Nah... It&#39;s because when I want something, I like <em>really</em> lock in and go for it... and <em>that&#39;s</em> why I get it.&quot; Hesse then writes him as like a bad ass sigma male. By this point I&#39;m wondering why Hesse won a Nobel and seriously considering dnf-ing the book.</p> <p>But, as Siddhartha ages, the more I started to like the book. I am probably close to the age Siddhartha is by the end, and that&#39;s the part that resonated with me the most. As Siddhartha ages, the philosophy and spiritualism Hesse writes gets deeper. As Siddhartha reflects on how his youthful arrogance prevented him from achieving true peace I saw that Hesse didn&#39;t write cringe spiritualism in the beginning because he&#39;s a cringe spiritualist, but because the beginning of every transformation, change, and growth is awkward and cringe. I&#39;ve also read reviews that <em>Siddhartha</em> hits differently every time you read it. I believe it, and I think Hesse did a great job of writing <em>Siddhartha</em> in a way that really reinforces the idea that he shares towards the end.</p> <p>I finished the book a few days ago and I&#39;m still chewing on it so I would love to hear any thoughts you might want to share. The more I think about <em>Siddhartha</em>, the more it reminds me of <em>The Wind in the Willow</em> by Kenneth Grahame and if you see the parallels as well, I would love to hear about that too.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Anxious-Fun8829\"> /u/Anxious-Fun8829 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1qgviy4/siddhartha_by_hermann_hesse/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1qgviy4/siddhartha_by_hermann_hesse/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Most mornings, around half past ten, Sybil sits down to write letters—to her brother, to her best friend, to the president of the university who will not allow her to audit a class she desperately wants to take, to Joan Didion and Larry McMurtry to tell them what she thinks of their latest books, and to one person to whom she writes often yet never sends the letter. Sybil expects her world to go on as it always has—a mother, grandmother, wife, divorcee, distinguished lawyer, she has lived a very full life. But when letters from someone in her past force her to examine one of the most painful periods of her life, she realizes that the letter she has been writing over the years needs to be read and that she cannot move forward until she finds it in her heart to offer forgiveness.</td> <td><a href=\"/u/deepfriednarwhals\">/u/deepfriednarwhals</a></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>1st Runner-Up TIE</strong></td> <td><em>The Names</em></td> <td>Florence Knapp</td> <td>In the wake of a catastrophic storm, Cora sets off with her nine-year-old daughter, Maia, to register the birth of her son. Her husband, Gordon, respected in the community but a controlling presence at home, intends for her to follow a long-standing family tradition and name the baby after him. But when faced with the decision, Cora hesitates.... Spanning thirty-five years, what follows are three alternate and alternating versions of their lives, shaped by Cora&#39;s last-minute choice of name.</td> <td><a href=\"/u/Lazybunny_\">/u/Lazybunny_</a></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>1st Runner-Up TIE</strong></td> <td><em>Sky Daddy</em></td> <td>Kate Folk</td> <td>Linda is doing her best to lead a life that would appear normal to the casual observer. Weekdays, she earns $20 an hour moderating comments for a video-sharing platform, then rides the bus home to the windowless garage she rents on the outskirts of San Francisco. But on the last Friday of each month, she indulges in her true passion: taking BART to SFO for a round-trip flight to a regional hub. The destination is irrelevant because each trip means a new date with a handsome stranger—a stranger whose intelligent windscreens, sleek fuselages, and powerful engines make Linda feel a way that no human ever could. Linda knows that she can’t tell anyone she’s sexually obsessed with planes—nor can she reveal her belief her destiny is to “marry” one of her suitors by dying in a plane crash, thereby uniting her with her soulmate plane for eternity. But when an opportunity arises to hasten her dream of eternal partnership, and the carefully balanced elements of her life begin to spin out of control, she must choose between maintaining the trappings of normalcy and launching herself headlong toward the love she’s always dreamed of.</td> <td><a href=\"/u/Curiousfeline467\">/u/Curiousfeline467</a></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <h1><a href=\"/r/books/comments/1plkuvb/best_literary_fiction_of_2025_voting_thread/\">Best Literary Fiction of 2025</a></h1> <table><thead> <tr> <th>Place</th> <th>Title</th> <th>Author</th> <th>Description</th> <th>Nominated</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Winner</strong></td> <td><em>Wild Dark Shore</em></td> <td>Charlotte McConaghy</td> <td>Dominic Salt and his three children are caretakers of Shearwater, a tiny island not far from Antarctica.

Most people think it’s just a depiction of the sea. But Louisa, an aspiring artist herself, knows otherwise, and she is determined to find out the story of these three enigmatic figures. Twenty-five years earlier, in a distant seaside town, a group of teenagers find refuge from their bruising home lives by spending long summer days on an abandoned pier, telling silly jokes, sharing secrets, and committing small acts of rebellion. These lost souls find in each other a reason to get up each morning, a reason to dream, a reason to love. Out of that summer emerges a transcendent work of art, a painting that will unexpectedly be placed into eighteen-year-old Louisa’s care. She embarks on a surprise-filled cross-country journey to learn how the painting came to be and to decide what to do with it.

To solve the case, the Empire calls on its most brilliant and mercurial investigator, the great Ana Dolabra. At her side, as always, is her bemused assistant Dinios Kol. Before long, Ana’s discovered that they’re not investigating a disappearance, but a murder—and that the killing was just the first chess move by an adversary who seems to be able to pass through warded doors like a ghost, and who can predict every one of Ana’s moves as though they can see the future.

Blending poetry and philosophical inquiry with rich reflections on our discombobulating times, Balle’s On the Calculation of Volume asks us to consider: What is a single person’s responsibility to humanity and to the preservation of this world?</td> <td><a href=\"/u/mg132\">/u/mg132</a></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <h1><a href=\"/r/books/comments/1plkuxc/best_book_cover_of_2025_voting_thread/\">Best Book Cover of 2025</a></h1> <table><thead> <tr> <th>Place</th> <th>Title</th> <th>Author</th> <th>Cover Artist</th> <th>Book Cover</th> <th>Nominated</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Winner</strong></td> <td><em>Water Moon</em></td> <td>Samantha Sotto Yambao</td> <td>Haylee Morice</td> <td><a href=\"https://images2.penguinrandomhouse.com/cover/9780593725016\">Link</a></td> <td><a href=\"/u/Comprehensive-Fun47\">/u/Comprehensive-Fun47</a></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>1st Runner-Up</strong></td> <td><em>Katabasis</em></td> <td>R.F.

      "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1qge2n8/some_people_need_killing_mob_justice_and_societal/",
      "contentHtml": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>It has been said before that the best way to bring people together is to give them a good enemy. This has been something that has been said time and time again in different ways, but nevertheless is still a true sentiment and a tool that is used very often, especially amongst political figures, as their justification for eroding the rights and liberties of the citizens. Communism was the common enemy of the world during the first two Red Scare Periods and during those two periods, it was used as a justification for widespread human rights abuses and violations. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese were the common enemy, which led to their internment at the hands of the Roosevelt administration, with many of their lives being uprooted permanently. For Rodrigo Duterte, the former President of the Philippines, his common enemy was drug dealers and addicts. During his reign over the country, he waged a war on them, vowing to kill them and wipe them out to save his country from them, as well as the corrupt politicians he said were helping them. It was this period that saw widespread violations of both human and civil rights. Some People Need Killing is an examination of that war and its effects, but it is also a critique of the people who allowed it to happen and joined in on the war, much to the detriment of even their own family members. It is an examination of our carceral society and the belief in mob justice for those society deems the most incorrigible.</p> <p>Some People Need Killing is the best book that I read in the year 2025, and that is because not only is it an informative account of Filipino history, but it is also a testimony of the very angry sides of society. In the book, Patricia Evangelista makes it very clear that the book pulls no punches because she is, in the book and in life, a trauma journalist. She reports on the trauma that things cause people such as when she describes the effects of the natural disasters and seeing the pain that people experienced after. As a trauma journalist, she is reporting on the hardship that these people experience following very large events. In this book, while she is very clear on her anti-Duterte stance, it does not take away from the clear trauma that the policies of someone like Duterte caused for people. She also does this for former presidents like Aquino, who showed little to no regard for the victims of the hurricane and showed an ignorance that caused people to turn against him heavily. But when she starts talking about Duterte and his effect, it is very different, and let me explain why.</p> <p>So in the introduction to this post, I said that we live in a carceral society, so I first have to say what that means. A carceral society is when things are adjacent or like a prison. In these societies, punishment is placed over rehabilitation or redemption. I first came across this concept in this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3U20CRp_4k&amp;t=4s\">excellent video</a> by the YouTuber Shanspeare. This quote really takes the cake:</p> <p>&gt;Rachel Zegler&#39;s hate campaign is part of an ever-moving and violently popular environment where women are targeted by droves of individuals and institutions. In the beginning, these attacks are disguised as criticism, but ultimately lack construction. These comments don&#39;t facilitate change or accountability on the part of the targeted woman. It just breeds fear and defeat. That&#39;s the point. These hate campaigns are not done out of a desire to see someone become better or be held accountable. That&#39;s one way we know that they are influenced by our carceral culture. The point isn&#39;t restorative justice or rehabilitation. The point is to dehumanize and dispose of people.</p> <p>Carceral society hinges on this idea that the downtrodden or the rejects of society need to be disposed of, and the mob will take care of that for them. Duterte is someone who got the mob to engage in the bloodlust by giving them a good enemy. Drug addicts and dealers were made the enemy of the people. This book is very brutal, and that is on purpose. If this book weren&#39;t as vivid as it was with its imagery, the message would be lost. The damaging effects of what happened and the trauma it caused the country would be lost so it needs to put an up close and personal look to the stories. By doing this, it creates a very human look at the people who were affected by this, and that is something that the government did not do when they enacted this &quot;war&quot;.</p> <p>Listening to how Pat describes her job in this book is something that would send chills up the spine of just about anyone who does not work in her industry:</p> <p>&gt; <em>My job is to go to places where people die. I pack my bags, talk to the survivors, write my stories, then go home to wait for the next catastrophe. I don&#39;t wait very long.</em></p> <p>And to see where the quote comes from, it is not hard to see why this book is a very heavy read. It comes from a vigilante who was responsible for the deaths of quite a few people. In the carceral society, this is a very common sentiment:</p> <p>&gt; &quot;I&#39;m really not a bad guy,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;m not all bad. Some people need killing.&quot;</p> <p>This is a sentiment that many people get behind, depending on who the people are that supposedly need killing. In this book, not only did the government get in on this &quot;war&quot;, but society also got involved actively. Pat made sure to include several testimonials from people who reported their own family members and actively campaigned for the war, believing it to be a good thing, now that they have found what is tearing apart society and their families. It presents a first-person side of things from real-life experiences.</p> <p>The book calls out society for some of the more morbid ideas that can and have become more prevalent. It was written in 2023; however, as we say a lot, this book has many points that are relevant to this day. I suggest getting a copy, or if you are someone who prefers it, there is an audiobook on Spotify that is narrated by the author. This book is definitely the best book that I read in 2025.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Longjumping_Gain_807\"> /u/Longjumping_Gain_807 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1qge2n8/some_people_need_killing_mob_justice_and_societal/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1qge2n8/some_people_need_killing_mob_justice_and_societal/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1qfcnqk/ive_spent_2025_reading_modern_fantasy_here_are/",
      "contentHtml": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Last year I wrote a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1i46ycb/ive_spent_2024_reading_modern_and_classical_scifi/\">post</a> about my sci-fi journey in 2024 and what I thought about each book I read. I enjoyed the whole process (both the reading and reviewing) so I thought I’d do it again this year, with modern fantasy.</p> <p>While I’m not a complete newcomer to fantasy, I mostly only read the big series (LotR, ASoIaF, WoT, Witcher, HP etc.), and not much of modern fantasy, so I wanted to explore how the genre is progressing in the new millennium. I considered any series that started after 2000 to be modern fantasy, which might not be the best categorization, but that’s where I drew the line.</p> <p>I wasn’t able to read as much as last year, but still managed to read 22 books from 12 series. There are a couple of big misses, and believe me, there were like 10 other series on my list that I just couldn’t make time for – but hey, at least, I’ll not run out of reading material any time soon.</p> <p>I’ll try to avoid spoilers; however, I consider a book’s main premise and plot points that could be on the back cover fair game - so if you want to go into these books completely blind, don’t read further. </p> <p>So here are my reviews (in reading order): </p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Fourth Wing (Rebecca Yarros)</strong><br/> This book is a mess. But a fun one! I accidentally started my fantasy year with Fourth Wing (didn’t yet know that I’ll do a modern fantasy year) after my wife got it for Christmas last year, and it looked like a solid fantasy from the cover. As I wanted something different after all the sci-fi of the year before, I went in completely blind. I didn’t even know about the romantasy genre before, and I thought this would be something like an Eragon-esque easy fantasy. Imagine my surprise when the book turned out to be 50% lusting after male bodies with the other 50% being some random fantasy setting with so many plot holes that you wonder if there’s actually a plot between the 14-page long sex scenes. So how is it fun? Well, it’s just easy to read, and you can quickly get on board after you realize during the first few chapters that there isn’t that much to pay attention to, and you can just cruise along the story. The book also doesn’t pretend to be more serious than it is, so you can just lean back and read what technically can be called a story, but mostly you’ll read how amazing Xanden’s body is. By the way, I’m not being sarcastic, I did have fun reading it – it’s actually interesting what no expectations does to the enjoyment of a story. But during it I was also really hoping that this isn’t what modern fantasy has grown into. <strong>6/10</strong> </p></li> <li><p><strong>The Kingkiller Chronicle (Patrick Rothfuss)</strong><br/> Luckily, I picked up the Kingkiller Chronicle right after Fourth Wing, and it proved right away that modern fantasy can be good, or great even. Despite the series not being perfect (not the least because it’s not finished), it’s just written so well that it’s easy to overlook its flaws. The prose is great, the narrative is fascinating and the challenges our protagonist faces are dynamic and well-paced. I was thoroughly entertained while reading it. However, the further I’m from the actual reading experience, the more the flaws become apparent. For example, the protagonist is the biggest Gary Stu I’ve ever read (I know he’s an unreliable narrator, but you can’t be world-class at magic, music, sex and eastern martial arts at the same time), he is super white-knighty and the story, while posing many fascinating mysteries, doesn’t seem to have actual answers to them. But as I said, I didn’t sense much of this while reading the book, so I might be a little bit too critical due to the time passed. It’s still a great read, just don’t think about it too hard afterwards :) <strong>8/10</strong> </p> <ul> <li><strong>The Name of the Wind</strong> encompasses everything that works great about the series – the story is well-paced, the proposed mysteries are intriguing, the framing story is done really well and the narrative still feels on track. Yes, the above-mentioned issues are already there, but the good parts overwhelm them, making this book a very enjoyable read. <strong>8.5/10</strong><br/></li> <li><strong>The Wise Man&#39;s Fear</strong> is where the story kind of starts moving in circles. When I was almost done with the first half of the book, and we were still at the magic school, I knew there was no way the plot could advance at a pace that it needed to get at least some progress on the mysteries and the main plot. And this became even more apparent as the second half of the book starts to feel like a series of independent adventures with the same protagonist – each interesting in their own way, but not really being parts of a cohesive narrative. Still, it’s an enjoyable book, and I really hope that eventually we’ll get the third one and get some closure on the story. <strong>7.5/10</strong> </li> <li><strong>The Slow Regard of Silent Things</strong> is a novella based around one of the side characters in the series and is written very differently than the main books. It’s a classical case of an author experimenting with different styles – Rothfuss admits as much in the foreword – and I get what he’s going for, I just didn’t enjoy it that much. It was an interesting reading experience, but I felt like there wasn’t much substance besides the unique mindset (or mental illness) of the protagonist. <strong>6.5/10</strong> </li> </ul></li> <li><p><strong>The First Law Trilogy (Joe Abercrombie)</strong><br/> The First Law Trilogy is actually really just one big book, separated into three smaller, but still big ones, and with the author leaning heavily into the three-act structure, the three books cleanly become the three acts. Now this has its pros and cons. The con is mainly suffered by the first book, where it takes sooo much time to get things going and pull our characters together, but after you get through it, the second book quickly starts to repay your investment as you get more into the story and the characters, and the third book becomes one of the most epic conclusions I’ve read this year. Also, speaking of characters, this is where Abercrombie shines the most. The story (for me) was nothing special, but the characters are extremely complex and well written. It’s rare when the same characters can act completely differently between two situations and still be believable, but Abercrombie nails these changes and he shows how societal setting and group pressure influence even what seem to be core personality traits – I’ve never felt more validated for having different personalities for different friend groups! Also Glokta is probably in the top 5 fantasy characters of all time. So to sum it up, it’s a great read, after you get through book (or act) 1. <strong>8.5/10</strong> </p> <ul> <li>As mentioned, <strong>The Blade Itself</strong> isn’t a great standalone book. I found myself asking multiple times ‘Why am I reading about these people?’ throughout the book, as our main characters seemingly don’t have any connection to each other or any impact on the world. And sure, by the end of the book it all comes together, and you realize that this 500-page book was just a prelude to the actual story. And looking back, everything kind of falls into place, but it’s a bit of a struggle as a first-time reader. However, it does a lot of groundwork for the characters and the world for the next books, so I can’t be too mad at it. <strong>7/10</strong><br/></li> <li>In <strong>Before They Are Hanged</strong> the story finally takes off for real. Our characters begin to interact with each other and their dynamic is great. Some plots are still separated and there’s a weird choice to have half of the POV characters in the same group throughout the book, and in the least interesting storyline which thus takes up a lot of space that could’ve been spent elsewhere. But regardless, the characters really start to shine through the pages, and so I started to understand why this series is so recommended. <strong>8/10</strong> </li> <li><strong>Last Argument of Kings</strong> concludes the series in an epic fashion – and it’s easy to do so as the first two books really built up everything that was needed for it. I found the ending for each character perfect – not the ending I would’ve liked for the character, but the ending they needed to have based on everything that came before. In the end there’s one storyline I didn’t like – the magic one with Bayaz – as I felt it took away from the groundedness of the others. But everything else was great, and this book can be held up as a prime example of how to finish a series. <strong>9/10</strong> </li> </ul></li> <li><p><strong>Best Served Cold (Joe Abercrombie)</strong><br/> While not a direct sequel to the First Law trilogy, Best Served Cold clearly continues down the grimdark road of the first books. Brandon Sanderson defined grimdark as a story where “each and every good deed is punished”, and this has never been more true than in Best Served Cold. Anytime a character does something even mildly nice, they are severely punished for it after – and to be honest this becomes a little predictable as the story goes on. However, the more focused plot allows a smoother and more streamlined reading experience, where the narrative is clear, the stakes are clear and our characters can shine from the beginning. There’s a noticeable shift towards a more stylized dialogue (and there is a lot of dialogue), with the style of gangster movies (from the likes of Guy Ritchie and Tarantino) serving as a clear inspiration. For me, this stylized prose has become a little bit much by the end (after all we’re talking about a 680-page book, not a 2-hour movie), but it might be that I’ve read too much Abercrombie in one go. So after this, I’ve kept the First Law books on hold for the rest of the year, but I’ll probably return to them in a year or two. <strong>7.5/10</strong> </p></li> <li><p><strong>The Powder Mage (Brian McClellan)</strong><br/> I’m a little ambivalent (though leaning positive) about these books. First, this series has the most original magic system I’ve read all year and it’s integrated perfectly into the American/French revolution aesthetic, and these really provide the series with a strong backbone. But (and here comes the big <em>but</em>) I can’t for the life of me understand why the author felt the need to introduce a different, super generic classical fantasy magic system into the story, and also why, oh why do we need to have gods in this universe. There are so many stories about fireball-throwing, lightning-shooting, ice-summoning magi that aim to prevent/bring forward the summoning of a god (isn’t this the plot of every second World of Warcraft raid?) that it’s just super played out for me. Maybe it’s just me, but I feel like these additions really take away from the strongest aspects (setting and the powder magic) of the books. The other elements of the book are well written, the story is sound, most of the characters are interesting (especially Tamas), however they’re just that – well written, not extraordinary. <strong>7.5/10</strong> </p> <ul> <li><strong>Promise of Blood</strong> starts the series strongly with an ongoing coup, which gives it a nice dynamic to the first part of the book. This, and all similar political intrigue plots are the best part of the story. However, we soon leave this behind as we have our – otherwise likable – investigator character going after some prophecy bullsh*t. I think I made it clear above how I feel about this, but nevertheless, it’s a fine first entry of the series, even if I had problems with parts of the plot. <strong>7/10</strong></li> <li><strong>The Crimson Campaign</strong> is the best entry in the series – coincidentally the one with the least generic fantasy plots – I especially enjoyed the death march behind enemy lines, where it constantly felt like the characters were on their last legs, but still, their solutions (mostly) didn’t feel forced or convenient. At one point, however, I had to realize I didn’t really care for Taniel (who is one of the main characters), which sucks as he had some interesting plotlines, but his personality is just not very likable. <strong>8/10</strong> </li> <li>Aaaaand we’re back with the god stuff in <strong>The Autumn Republic</strong>. I know, even I’m bored of my complaints by now, but what can I do? It just bugs me about these books. We get another god, and his deal is… election campaigns and trade unions. I mean, at this point, what’s the point of him being a god? I really like all the political plots and maneuvering, but the sharp contrast between the groundedness of the story and the fantasy elements really bothered me right to the end. But besides this, the ending is a competent and satisfying way to conclude the series, which after all, I’m glad I’ve read. <strong>7.5/10</strong> </li> </ul></li> <li><p><strong>A Darker Shade of Magic (V. E. Schwab)</strong><br/> This book has so much wasted potential. I was hooked on the world as soon as I read the synopsis – four parallel Londons, that are similar, but are shaped by different events into becoming separate worlds – how cool is that? I couldn’t wait for the author to highlight the comparisons between each world and show how they are alike, but not alike at the same time. However, it turns out my expectations were way too high. Instead of exciting alternative Londons we got Boring (Real) London, Generic Good London, Generic Evil London and Generic Extra Evil London. The only parallels between them are that there’s one(!) building in the exact same place in each and there’s a Thames in all of them. So not very exciting. But how about the characters, the story? Those were to me kind of average – there wasn’t anything wrong with them per se, but I just couldn’t really get involved. One problem I had is that there’s a lot of ‘tell, don’t show’, for example, we are told again and again how our protagonist loves his brother, and this even becomes a key plot point down the line. However, the only interaction we see between them before things go down is when they argue with each other – we don’t see them having fun or hanging out or anything, and this really hampers the impact of the later parts of the book. There are other examples of this, so in the end this book didn’t really grab me, so I didn’t read further into the series. <strong>6/10</strong> </p></li> <li><p><strong>Green Bone Saga (Fonda Lee)</strong><br/> The Green Bone Saga is the best series I’ve read this year. Its setting (a fantasy world that’s parallel to our 1970s East Asia) and themes are completely unique in this genre and Fonda Lee handles these magnificently. She tackles topics like how globalization affects traditional societies, how immigrant groups try to hold on to their native culture, while trying to adhere to the norms of the country they’re in, how honor-based rules and traditions collide with what’s essentially becoming a modernized world and other difficult topics that are usually absent in fantasy literature. All of these are presented as real challenges for the characters, without falling into the evil globalization vs. morally pure native dichotomy – in which it helps that our protagonists are organized criminals. This is also handled wonderfully as the characters are nuanced, flawed, but still very human and understandable, or even likable. I didn’t give a perfect score to any of the books as the first one lacks the ambitious themes of the whole series, while the latter two’s story is less focused due to the growing scope. However, in total it really is greater than the sum of its parts, so as a series it gets a perfect <strong>10/10</strong> from me.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Jade City</strong> is the most focused and dynamic story out of the three books (the story happens in just 6 months, instead of the years the following books tackle), and it pulls the reader right in. The living, breathing city of Janloon provides a wonderful backdrop to the great characters whose unique struggles and challenges are super captivating. The author doesn’t hold any punches, the stakes are real and high. The book lacks the thematical depth of the rest of the series, but it’s a near-perfect story on its own as well. <strong>9/10</strong><br/></li> <li><strong>Jade War</strong> starts to broaden the story with more perspectives. We meet immigrant communities, our characters start to feel the grasps of globalization and how super-powers influence and vie over resource-rich, but smaller countries. And these are just the background themes behind a good-old clan war. However, to show all this, the story becomes less focused and a little bit too broad, but it’s all worth it in the end. <strong>8.5/10</strong> </li> <li>With <strong>Jade Legacy</strong> we’re moving into modernity, and with it, the changing of traditional values, generational differences and the societal volatility that is caused by all these drive the story forward. The story is even less focused – it takes place over 20 years -, so there are places where I was not yet ready for the time-jumps and wanted to read more about certain situations, but I accept that to tackle these themes, these were unavoidable. The conclusion is handled extremely well, it’s perfectly bittersweet and rounds out a great reading experience in total. <strong>8.5/10</strong> </li> </ul></li> <li><p><strong>The Lies of Locke Lamora (Scott Lynch)</strong><br/> The Lies of Locke Lamora is a fine book with likable characters and a well-written story. However, the flow of the book really threw me off. We’d start a heist in the present, then flashback to a storyline from 10 years ago then have a flashback <em>inside</em> the flashback. Then back to the present story. Then flashback again. And this goes on throughout the book. Maybe it would’ve been fine, if the glimpses to the past were interesting at least, but I found most of them quite boring, especially as I couldn’t wait to get on with the main story. But no, we had to see what irrelevant things happened to our characters 10 years ago (so a secondary character pretended to be a priest for a while, thanks, now can we go back to the literal climax of the book?). But at least the main story was interesting, and the characters were great as well. I especially liked that the author didn’t hold any punches, and there were real stakes and consequences. But in the end, I couldn’t really get over the flow and structure of the story, and while I liked the book at a lot of places, I don’t think I’ll continue with the series. <strong>7/10</strong> </p></li> <li><p><strong>Bloodsworn Saga (John Gwynne)</strong><br/> Surprisingly, I haven’t yet encountered many fantasy books that are based on Nordic culture. It’s surprising as it lends itself super well to the genre as it’s showcased by the Bloodsworn Saga. It’s just familiar enough so that concepts don’t have to be over-explained and unusual enough so it’s not just another fantasy world that’s basically medieval Europe. So the setting is great, the worldbuilding is solid, but the story has some issues. Nothing to ruin the experience, and I enjoyed the books and the story, but it won’t be a 10/10. And although I didn’t have time to read the third book this year (it was already November when I finished the second book and I wanted to dig into a few more series), I’m definitely picking it up next year, as I’m quite interested in how the story ends. <strong>7.5/10</strong> </p> <ul> <li>I imagine <strong>The Shadow of the Gods</strong> was written like this: the author wrote a very solid story, then said ‘Hey, this is a pretty good, let’s duplicate everything, it’ll be twice as good!’. And behold: there are 2 very similar mercenary groups, 2 moms looking for their kidnapped kids, 2 <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">protagonists with wolf powers</span>, 2 <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">groups going north to explore sites of fallen gods</span>, and I could go on. The two very similar mercenary groups are my biggest gripe, as several times I had to stop and think about which character is part of which one. But besides this, as I said, it’s a pretty good story, action-packed and dynamic. The characters are solid, not necessarily complicated, but there are a couple of twists about them that make them interesting. <strong>7.5/10</strong><br/></li> <li><strong>The Hunger of the Gods</strong> picks up where the previous book finished, the dynamism and action continues, but this time it got a little too much for me. Basically what happens is that the 3 original characters go from place to place and kill everything in-between. Lots of broken skulls, slit up bellies, and cut-off appendages. It gets a little tiresome after a while and by the end I found myself skimming over the battle scenes, as after a point they all seemed the same. The actionmovie-esque writing also introduces some weird things, like super short chapters (there’s a chapter that’s just 2 pages long), that I imagine should evoke the effect of a camera cutting back-and-forth between two characters, but it just didn’t work for me that much. What did work for me are the parts that are NOT filled with gore and violence and chopped off fingers: there are a couple of new characters whose story is not as action-packed and they slow the narrative down nicely and we’re shown some nice character development, intrigue and much-needed breathing space between the other chapters. <strong>7/10</strong> </li> </ul></li> <li><p><strong>The Poppy War (R. F. Kuang)</strong><br/> This is a weird one. While The Poppy War does a lot of things well – showing how seemingly “meritocratic” systems can entrench the power of the ruling class, providing a perspective into women’s challenges in highly competitive environments etc. –, but there are just so many things wrong with the book that I just couldn’t enjoy it in the end. First, the prose is clunky in a lot of places, e.g. it sometimes goes from third-person limited to third-person omniscient point-of-view within the same chapter. Then the worldbuilding is really unimaginative: it’s just China, that’s it, with some magic (plus Japan and the Western countries). For example, quotes in the book in-story are from real Chinese philosophers with their actual name included, which is quite jarring. If the author wanted to do an alternative mystical version of China, why create a seemingly new fantasy world, that just comes off as lazy worldbuilding? Lastly, the tone of the book is extremely inconsistent. One chapter I’m worrying about the story turning into a YA-style love triangle, and the (literally) next chapter describes some of the most extreme, horrendous atrocities I’ve ever read in ANY book. This last part is so insanely out-of-place, unexpected and unwanted that I considered not finishing the book. I powered through, but I most certainly won’t read the rest of the series and I might just keep away from all future books of the author. <strong>5.5/10</strong> </p></li> <li><p><strong>Piranesi (Susanna Clarke)</strong><br/> This was a great read! Piranesi is a unique take on the “infinite house” trope, where the mystery is captivating, and the plot is excellently written. Many mysteries fail to involve the reader in the solution, making it impossible to come to the right conclusion on our own (I’m looking at you <em>literally every detective book ever</em>), but not Piranesi. Here, when a new clue was introduced, I was able to figure it out maybe a page or two before the protagonist came to his conclusions. I also didn’t have to “wait” for him over chapters to figure out something obvious. This shows how well-written and well-paced the story is. My only criticism would be that the ending was a little too neat (but this is a matter of taste) and that I would have liked an additional ~100 pages of non-plot-heavy exploration of the House that could’ve let the story breathe a little more, especially in the later chapters. <strong>9/10</strong> </p></li> <li><p><strong>The Fifth Season (N. K. Jemisin)</strong><br/> I enjoyed The Fifth Season thoroughly. It’s interesting in more ways than one, the plot is solid, the characters are great and the world is fascinating. I also liked how it went against some usual trends and e.g. used a second-person narrative in a few chapters – it’s clear that the author didn’t just follow formulas, but went in her own direction. The worldbuilding is also not just the usual “medieval equivalent of our world with magic” that a lot of fantasy books fall into, it’s a well thought-out, convincing world, where people aren’t based on a particular “real” civilization, but rather their culture corresponds to the challenges and problems that are in their own lives and world. Sadly, I didn’t have time to read the rest of the series in 2025, but I’ll certainly start 2026 with the next book. <strong>9/10</strong> </p></li> <li><p><strong>The Curse of Chalion (Lois McMaster Bujold)</strong><br/> The final book of my modern fantasy year turned out to be not a modern fantasy, but a very much classical one. Even though it was released after my arbitrary deadline of 2000, the contrast between this book and the others I’ve read are stark: the morally grey protagonists are nowhere to be seen, here the good characters are good, the bad ones are bad; the good princess is beautiful and she marries the brave prince; the gods are kind and try to help the mortals against the evil of the world. If I’m being completely honest, it was a bit of fresh air after all the complicated themes, ambiguous motivations and uncomfortable stories. So this review and score might be a little inflated by this, but I really enjoyed The Curse of Chalion. The story flowed smoothly, the challenges were substantial, but not unconquerable, the good characters were likable, the bad ones were appropriately dislikable and the whole narrative was built up and then closed in a satisfying way. Of course, I didn’t gain any new perspective, neither was I surprised by anything that happened, but this is definitely a solid book to read, and I’m glad I finished my year with this one. <strong>8/10</strong></p></li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/trollokvoltak\"> /u/trollokvoltak </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1qfcnqk/ive_spent_2025_reading_modern_fantasy_here_are/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1qfcnqk/ive_spent_2025_reading_modern_fantasy_here_are/\">[comments]</a></span>",

by Hermann Hesse is a novella chronicling the spiritual journey of a man named Siddhartha (note, not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; Siddhartha) as he leaves his family in search of spiritual enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I read a comment online awhile back saying something along the line of &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Siddhartha&lt;/em&gt; is a book one should read when they&amp;#39;re seventeen, and only when they&amp;#39;re seventeen.&amp;quot; I also recall a comment that called Hermann Hesse &amp;quot;The German Paulo Coelho&amp;quot;. Though I have not read &lt;em&gt;The Alchemist&lt;/em&gt;, I am familiar with its reputation, so I probably had some bias going into the book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I found the philosophy and spirituality shallow at first and Siddhartha kind of gave off a podcast bro vibe. About halfway through the book someone points out to Siddhartha that things work out in his favor because of his privileges, and he&amp;#39;s like, &amp;quot;Nah... It&amp;#39;s because when I want something, I like &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; lock in and go for it... and &lt;em&gt;that&amp;#39;s&lt;/em&gt; why I get it.&amp;quot; Hesse then writes him as like a bad ass sigma male. By this point I&amp;#39;m wondering why Hesse won a Nobel and seriously considering dnf-ing the book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But, as Siddhartha ages, the more I started to like the book. I am probably close to the age Siddhartha is by the end, and that&amp;#39;s the part that resonated with me the most. As Siddhartha ages, the philosophy and spiritualism Hesse writes gets deeper. As Siddhartha reflects on how his youthful arrogance prevented him from achieving true peace I saw that Hesse didn&amp;#39;t write cringe spiritualism in the beginning because he&amp;#39;s a cringe spiritualist, but because the beginning of every transformation, change, and growth is awkward and cringe. I&amp;#39;ve also read reviews that &lt;em&gt;Siddhartha&lt;/em&gt; hits differently every time you read it. I believe it, and I think Hesse did a great job of writing &lt;em&gt;Siddhartha&lt;/em&gt; in a way that really reinforces the idea that he shares towards the end.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I finished the book a few days ago and I&amp;#39;m still chewing on it so I would love to hear any thoughts you might want to share. The more I think about &lt;em&gt;Siddhartha&lt;/em&gt;, the more it reminds me of &lt;em&gt;The Wind in the Willow&lt;/em&gt; by Kenneth Grahame and if you see the parallels as well, I would love to hear about that too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/Anxious-Fun8829&quot;&gt; /u/Anxious-Fun8829 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1qgviy4/siddhartha_by_hermann_hesse/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1qgviy4/siddhartha_by_hermann_hesse/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_1qgviy4</id><link href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1qgviy4/siddhartha_by_hermann_hesse/\" /><updated>2026-01-19T05:28:09+00:00</updated><published>2026-01-19T05:28:09+00:00</published><title>Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/ubcstaffer123</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/ubcstaffer123</uri></author><category term=\"books\" label=\"r/books\"/><content type=\"html\">&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1qhet1u/stalins_writings_to_feature_in_russian_economics/&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://external-preview.redd.it/fG8H5VHB0l-VjrlHCAjTAIC9_CNEeUUQh4MOXngj0Ac.jpeg?width=640&amp;amp;crop=smart&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c2751c15f77c59dd98df63288f248795a246966f&quot; alt=&quot;Stalin’s Writings to Feature in Russian Economics Textbook Rejecting “Only Democracies Prosper” Idea&quot; title=&quot;Stalin’s Writings to Feature in Russian Economics Textbook Rejecting “Only Democracies Prosper” Idea&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/ubcstaffer123&quot;&gt; /u/ubcstaffer123 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://united24media.com/latest-news/stalins-writings-to-feature-in-russian-economics-textbook-rejecting-only-democracies-prosper-idea-14970&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1qhet1u/stalins_writings_to_feature_in_russian_economics/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content><id>t3_1qhet1u</id><media:thumbnail url=\"https://external-preview.redd.it/fG8H5VHB0l-VjrlHCAjTAIC9_CNEeUUQh4MOXngj0Ac.jpeg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2751c15f77c59dd98df63288f248795a246966f\" /><link href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1qhet1u/stalins_writings_to_feature_in_russian_economics/\" /><updated>2026-01-19T19:56:12+00:00</updated><published>2026-01-19T19:56:12+00:00</published><title>Stalin’s Writings to Feature in Russian Economics Textbook Rejecting “Only Democracies Prosper” Idea</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/AutoModerator</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/AutoModerator</uri></author><category term=\"books\" label=\"r/books\"/><content type=\"html\">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What are you reading?

Most mornings, around half past ten, Sybil sits down to write letters—to her brother, to her best friend, to the president of the university who will not allow her to audit a class she desperately wants to take, to Joan Didion and Larry McMurtry to tell them what she thinks of their latest books, and to one person to whom she writes often yet never sends the letter. Sybil expects her world to go on as it always has—a mother, grandmother, wife, divorcee, distinguished lawyer, she has lived a very full life. But when letters from someone in her past force her to examine one of the most painful periods of her life, she realizes that the letter she has been writing over the years needs to be read and that she cannot move forward until she finds it in her heart to offer forgiveness.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/u/deepfriednarwhals&quot;&gt;/u/deepfriednarwhals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1st Runner-Up TIE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Names&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Florence Knapp&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;In the wake of a catastrophic storm, Cora sets off with her nine-year-old daughter, Maia, to register the birth of her son. Her husband, Gordon, respected in the community but a controlling presence at home, intends for her to follow a long-standing family tradition and name the baby after him. But when faced with the decision, Cora hesitates.... Spanning thirty-five years, what follows are three alternate and alternating versions of their lives, shaped by Cora&amp;#39;s last-minute choice of name.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/u/Lazybunny_&quot;&gt;/u/Lazybunny_&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1st Runner-Up TIE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sky Daddy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Kate Folk&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Linda is doing her best to lead a life that would appear normal to the casual observer. Weekdays, she earns $20 an hour moderating comments for a video-sharing platform, then rides the bus home to the windowless garage she rents on the outskirts of San Francisco. But on the last Friday of each month, she indulges in her true passion: taking BART to SFO for a round-trip flight to a regional hub. The destination is irrelevant because each trip means a new date with a handsome stranger—a stranger whose intelligent windscreens, sleek fuselages, and powerful engines make Linda feel a way that no human ever could. Linda knows that she can’t tell anyone she’s sexually obsessed with planes—nor can she reveal her belief her destiny is to “marry” one of her suitors by dying in a plane crash, thereby uniting her with her soulmate plane for eternity. But when an opportunity arises to hasten her dream of eternal partnership, and the carefully balanced elements of her life begin to spin out of control, she must choose between maintaining the trappings of normalcy and launching herself headlong toward the love she’s always dreamed of.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/u/Curiousfeline467&quot;&gt;/u/Curiousfeline467&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/r/books/comments/1plkuvb/best_literary_fiction_of_2025_voting_thread/&quot;&gt;Best Literary Fiction of 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Place&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Title&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Author&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Nominated&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wild Dark Shore&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Charlotte McConaghy&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Dominic Salt and his three children are caretakers of Shearwater, a tiny island not far from Antarctica. Home to the world’s largest seed bank, Shearwater was once full of researchers, but with sea levels rising, the Salts are now its final inhabitants. Until, during the worst storm the island has ever seen, a woman mysteriously washes ashore. Isolation has taken its toll on the Salts, but as they nurse the woman, Rowan, back to strength, it begins to feel like she might just be what they need. Rowan, long accustomed to protecting herself, starts imagining a future where she could belong to someone again. But Rowan isn’t telling the whole truth about why she set out for Shearwater. And when she discovers sabotaged radios and a freshly dug grave, she realizes Dominic is keeping his own secrets. As the storms on Shearwater gather force, they all must decide if they can trust each other enough to protect the precious seeds in their care before it’s too late―and if they can finally put the tragedies of the past behind them to create something new, together.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/u/nirgle&quot;&gt;/u/nirgle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1st Runner-Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Friends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Frederik Backman&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Most people don’t even notice them—three tiny figures sitting at the end of a long pier in the corner of one of the most famous paintings in the world. Most people think it’s just a depiction of the sea. But Louisa, an aspiring artist herself, knows otherwise, and she is determined to find out the story of these three enigmatic figures. Twenty-five years earlier, in a distant seaside town, a group of teenagers find refuge from their bruising home lives by spending long summer days on an abandoned pier, telling silly jokes, sharing secrets, and committing small acts of rebellion. These lost souls find in each other a reason to get up each morning, a reason to dream, a reason to love. Out of that summer emerges a transcendent work of art, a painting that will unexpectedly be placed into eighteen-year-old Louisa’s care. She embarks on a surprise-filled cross-country journey to learn how the painting came to be and to decide what to do with it. The closer she gets to the painting’s birthplace, the more nervous she becomes about what she’ll find.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/u/North-Library4037&quot;&gt;/u/North-Library4037&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2nd Runner-Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seascraper&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Benjamin Woods&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Thomas lives a slow, deliberate life with his mother in Longferry, working his grandpa’s trade as a shanker. He rises early to take his horse and cart to the grey, gloomy beach and scrape for shrimp, spending the afternoon selling his wares, trying to wash away the salt and scum, pining for Joan Wyeth down the street, and rehearsing songs on his guitar. At heart, he is a folk musician, but it remains a private dream. When a striking visitor turns up, bringing the promise of Hollywood glamour, Thomas is shaken from the drudgery of his days and begins to see a different future. But how much of what the American claims is true, and how far can his inspiration carry Thomas?&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/u/YourDadsMate&quot;&gt;/u/YourDadsMate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/r/books/comments/1plkuvi/best_mystery_or_thriller_of_2025_voting_thread/&quot;&gt;Best Mystery or Thriller of 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Place&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Title&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Author&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Nominated&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wild Dark Shore&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Charlotte McConaghy&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Dominic Salt and his three children are caretakers of Shearwater, a tiny island not far from Antarctica.

Cosby&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Roman Carruthers left the smoke and fire of his family&amp;#39;s crematory business behind in his hometown of Jefferson Run, Virginia. He is enjoying a life of shallow excess as a financial adviser in Atlanta until he gets a call from his sister, Neveah, telling him their father is in a coma after a hit-and-run accident. When Roman goes home, he learns the accident may not be what it seems. His brother, Dante, is deeply in debt to dangerous, ruthless criminals. And Roman is willing to do anything to protect his family. Anything. A financial whiz with a head for numbers and a talent for making his clients rich, Roman must use all his skills to try to save his family while dealing with a shadow that has haunted them all for twenty years: the disappearance of their mother when Roman and his siblings were teenagers. It&amp;#39;s a mystery that Neveah, who has sacrificed so much of her life to hold her family together, is determined to solve once and for all.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/u/Charles_Chuckles&quot;&gt;/u/Charles_Chuckles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2nd Runner-Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vera Wong&amp;#39;s Guide to Snooping [On a Dead Man]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Jesse Q. Sutanto&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Ever since a man was found dead in Vera&amp;#39;s teahouse, life has been good. For Vera that is. She’s surrounded by loved ones, her shop is bustling, and best of all, her son, Tilly, has a girlfriend! All thanks to Vera, because Tilly&amp;#39;s girlfriend is none other than Officer Selena Gray. The very same Officer Gray that she had harassed while investigating the teahouse murder. Still, Vera wishes more dead bodies would pop up in her shop, but one mustn&amp;#39;t be ungrateful, even if one is slightly...bored. Then Vera comes across a distressed young woman who is obviously in need of her kindly guidance. The young woman is looking for a missing friend. Fortunately, while cat-sitting at Tilly and Selena&amp;#39;s, Vera finds a treasure Selena&amp;#39;s briefcase. Inside is a file about the death of an enigmatic influencer—who also happens to be the friend that the young woman was looking for. Online, Xander had it a parade of private jets, fabulous parties with socialites, and a burgeoning career as a social media influencer. The only problem is, after his body is fished out of Mission Bay, the police can&amp;#39;t seem to actually identify him. Who is Xander Lin? Nobody knows. Every contact is a dead end. Everybody claims not to know him, not even his parents. Vera is determined to solve Xander&amp;#39;s murder. After all, doing so would surely be a big favor to Selena, and there is nothing she wouldn&amp;#39;t do for her future daughter-in-law.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/u/1142kayla&quot;&gt;/u/1142kayla&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/r/books/comments/1plkuvp/best_short_story_collection_of_2025_voting_thread/&quot;&gt;Best Short Story Collection of 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Place&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Title&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Author&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Nominated&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stag Dance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Torrey Peters&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;In Stag Dance, the titular novel, a group of restless lumberjacks working in an illegal winter logging outfit plan a dance that some of them will volunteer to attend as women. When the broadest, strongest, plainest of the axmen announces his intention to dance as a woman, he finds himself caught in a strange rivalry with a pretty young jack, provoking a cascade of obsession, jealousy, and betrayal that will culminate on the big night in an astonishing vision of gender and transition. Three startling stories surround Stag Dance: “Infect Your Friends and Loved Ones” imagines a gender apocalypse brought about by an unstable ex. In “The Chaser,” a secret romance between roommates at a Quaker boarding school brings out intrigue and cruelty. In the last story, “The Masker,” a party weekend on the Las Vegas strip turns dark when a young crossdresser must choose between two guides: a handsome mystery man who objectifies her in thrilling ways, or a cynical veteran trans woman offering unglamorous sisterhood.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/u/chanukkahlewinsky&quot;&gt;/u/chanukkahlewinsky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/r/books/comments/1plkuvw/best_graphic_novel_of_2025_voting_thread/&quot;&gt;Best Graphic Novel of 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Place&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Title&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Author&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Nominated&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spent: A Comic Novel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Alison Bechdel&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;In Alison Bechdel’s hilariously skewering and gloriously cast new comic novel confection, a cartoonist named Alison Bechdel, running a pygmy goat sanctuary in Vermont, is existentially irked by a climate-challenged world and a citizenry on the brink of civil war. Can she pull humanity out of its death spiral by writing a scathingly self-critical memoir about her own greed and privilege? Meanwhile, Alison’s first graphic memoir about growing up with her father, a taxidermist who specialized in replicas of Victorian animal displays, has been adapted into a highly successful TV series. It’s a phenomenon that makes Alison, formerly on the cultural margins, the envy of her friend group (recognizable as characters, now middle-aged and living communally in Vermont, from Bechdel’s beloved comic strip Dykes to Watch Out For). As the TV show Death and Taxidermy racks up Emmy after Emmy—and when Alison’s Pauline Bunyanesque partner Holly posts an instructional wood-chopping video that goes viral—Alison’s own envy spirals. Why couldn’t she be the writer for a critically lauded and wildly popular reality TV show…like Queer Eye...showing people how to free themselves from consumer capitalism and live a more ethical life?&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/u/candlesandpretense&quot;&gt;/u/candlesandpretense&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/r/books/comments/1plkuw4/best_poetry_collection_of_2025_voting_thread/&quot;&gt;Best Poetry of 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Place&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Title&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Author&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Nominated&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nightmare Sequence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Omar Sakr and Safdar Ahmed, George Abraham (Introduction)&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;The Nightmare Sequence is a searing response to the atrocities in Gaza and beyond since October 2023. Heartbreaking and humane, it is a necessary portrait of the violence committed by Israel and its Western allies. Through poetry and visual art, Omar Sakr and Safdar Ahmed capture these historic injustices, while also critiquing the role of art and media – including their own – in this time. Born of collective suffering and despair, their collaboration interrogates the position of witness: the terrible and helpless distance of vision, the impact of being exposed to violence of this scale on a daily basis, and what it means to live in a society that is actively participating in the catastrophic destruction of Arabs and Muslims overseas.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/u/FlyByTieDye&quot;&gt;/u/FlyByTieDye&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/r/books/comments/1plkuw8/best_science_fiction_of_2025_voting_thread/&quot;&gt;Best Science Fiction of 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Place&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Title&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Author&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Nominated&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shroud&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Adrian Tchaikovsky&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;New planets are fair game to asset strippers and interplanetary opportunists – and a commercial mission to a distant star system discovers a moon that is pitch black, but alive with radio activity. Its high-gravity, high-pressure, zero-oxygen environment is anathema to human life, but ripe for exploitation. They named it Shroud. Under no circumstances should a human end up on Shroud’s inhospitable surface. Except a catastrophic accident sees Juna Ceelander and Mai Ste Etienne doing just that. Forced to stage an emergency landing, in a small, barely adequate vehicle, they are unable to contact their ship and are running out of time. What follows is a gruelling journey across land, sea and air. During this time, Juna and Mai begin to understand Shroud’s dominant species. It also begins to understand them . . . If they escape Shroud, they’ll face a crew only interested in profiteering from this extraordinary world. They’ll somehow have to explain the impossible and translate the incredible. That is, if they make it back at all.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/u/murchtheevilsquirrel&quot;&gt;/u/murchtheevilsquirrel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1st Runner-Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Terrestrial History&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Joe Mungo Reed&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Hannah is a fusion scientist working in a cottage off the coast of Scotland when she’s approached by a visitor from the future, a young man from a human settlement on Mars, traveling backward through time to intervene in the fate of a warming planet. Roban lives in the Colony, a sterile outpost of civilization, where he longs for the wonders of a home planet he never knew. Between Hannah and Roban, two generations, a father and a daughter, face down an uncertain future. Andrew believes there is still time for the human spirit to triumph. For his rationalist daughter Kenzie, such idealism is not enough to keep the rising floods at bay, so she signs on to work for a company that would abandon Earth for the promise of a world beyond.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/u/deepfriednarwhals&quot;&gt;/u/deepfriednarwhals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2nd Runner-Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where the Axe is Buried&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Ray Nayler&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;In the authoritarian Federation, there is a plot to assassinate and replace the President, a man who has downloaded his mind to a succession of new bodies to maintain his grip on power. Meanwhile, on the fringes of a Western Europe that has renounced human governance in favor of ostensibly more efficient, objective, and peaceful AI Prime Ministers, an experimental artificial mind is malfunctioning, threatening to set off a chain of events that may spell the end of the Western world. As the Federation and the West both start to crumble, Lilia, the brilliant scientist whose invention may be central to bringing down the seemingly immortal President, goes on the run, trying to break out from a near-impenetrable web of Federation surveillance. Her fate is bound up with a worldwide group of others fighting against the global status quo: Palmer, the man Lilia left behind in London, desperate to solve the mystery of her disappearance; Zoya, a veteran activist imprisoned in the taiga, whose book has inspired a revolutionary movement; Nikolai, the President’s personal physician, who has been forced into more and more harrowing decisions as he navigates the Federation’s palace politics; and Nurlan, the hapless parliamentary staffer whose attempt to save his Republic goes terribly awry. And then there is Krotov, head of the Federation’s security services, whose plots, agents, and assassins are everywhere.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/u/npm0925&quot;&gt;/u/npm0925&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/r/books/comments/1plkuwd/best_fantasy_of_2025_voting_thread/&quot;&gt;Best Fantasy of 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Place&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Title&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Author&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Nominated&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Devils&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Joe Abercrombie&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Brother Diaz has been summoned to the Sacred City, where he is certain a commendation and grand holy assignment awaits him. But his new flock is made up of unrepentant murderers, practitioners of ghastly magic, and outright monsters, and the mission he is tasked with will require bloody measures from them all in order to achieve its righteous ends. Elves lurk at our borders and hunger for our flesh, while greedy princes care for nothing but their own ambitions and comfort. With a hellish journey before him, it&amp;#39;s a good thing Brother Diaz has the devils on his side.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/u/meeow3&quot;&gt;/u/meeow3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1st Runner-Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Drop of Corruption&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Robert Jackson Bennett&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;In the canton of Yarrowdale, at the very edge of the Empire’s reach, an impossible crime has occurred. A Treasury officer has disappeared into thin air—abducted from his quarters while the door and windows remained locked from the inside, in a building whose entrances and exits are all under constant guard. To solve the case, the Empire calls on its most brilliant and mercurial investigator, the great Ana Dolabra. At her side, as always, is her bemused assistant Dinios Kol. Before long, Ana’s discovered that they’re not investigating a disappearance, but a murder—and that the killing was just the first chess move by an adversary who seems to be able to pass through warded doors like a ghost, and who can predict every one of Ana’s moves as though they can see the future. Worse still, the killer seems to be targeting the high-security compound known as the Shroud. Here, the Empire&amp;#39;s greatest minds dissect fallen Titans to harness the volatile magic found in their blood. Should it fall, the destruction would be terrible indeed—and the Empire itself will grind to a halt, robbed of the magic that allows its wheels of power to turn. Din has seen Ana solve impossible cases before. But this time, with the stakes higher than ever and Ana seemingly a step behind their adversary at every turn, he fears that his superior has finally met an enemy she can’t defeat.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/u/jamieseemsamused&quot;&gt;/u/jamieseemsamused&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2nd Runner-Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Strength of the Few&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Joe Islington&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;The Hierarchy still call me Vis Telimus. Still hail me as Catenicus. They still, as one, believe they know who I am. But with all that has happened—with what I fear is coming—I am not sure it matters anymore. I am no longer one. I won the Iudicium, and lost everything—and now, impossibly, the ancient device beyond the Labyrinth has replicated me across three separate worlds. A different version of myself in each of Obiteum, Luceum, and Res. Three different bodies, three different lives. I have to hide; fight; play politics. I have to train; trust; lie. I have to kill; heal; prove myself again, and again, and again. I am loved, and hated, and entirely alone. Above all, though, I need to find answers before it’s too late. To understand the nature of what has happened to me, and why. I need to find a way to stop the coming Cataclysm, because if all I have learned is true, I may be the only one who can.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/u/derpderpingt&quot;&gt;/u/derpderpingt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/r/books/comments/1plkuwg/best_ya_of_2025_voting_thread/&quot;&gt;Best Young Adult of 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Place&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Title&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Author&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Nominated&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sunrise on the Reaping&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Suzanne Collins&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;As the day dawns on the fiftieth annual Hunger Games, fear grips the districts of Panem. This year, in honor of the Quarter Quell, twice as many tributes will be taken from their homes. Back in District 12, Haymitch Abernathy is trying not to think too hard about his chances. All he cares about is making it through the day and being with the girl he loves. When Haymitch&amp;#39;s name is called, he can feel all his dreams break. He&amp;#39;s torn from his family and his love, shuttled to the Capitol with the three other District 12 tributes: a young friend who&amp;#39;s nearly a sister to him, a compulsive oddsmaker, and the most stuck-up girl in town. As the Games begin, Haymitch understands he&amp;#39;s been set up to fail. But there&amp;#39;s something in him that wants to fight . . . and have that fight reverberate far beyond the deadly arena.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/u/coyoterose5&quot;&gt;/u/coyoterose5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1st Runner-Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hazelthorn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;CG Drews&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Evander has lived like a ghost in the forgotten corners of the Hazelthorn estate ever since he was taken in by his reclusive billionaire guardian, Byron Lennox-Hall, when he was a child. For his safety, Evander has been given three ironclad rules to follow: He can never leave the estate. He can never go into the gardens. And most importantly, he can never again be left alone with Byron&amp;#39;s charming, underachieving grandson, Laurie. That last rule has been in place ever since Laurie tried to kill Evander seven years ago, and yet somehow Evander is still obsessed with him. When Byron suddenly dies, Evander inherits Hazelthorn’s immense gothic mansion and acres of sprawling grounds, along with the entirety of the Lennox-Hall family&amp;#39;s vast wealth. But Evander&amp;#39;s sure his guardian was murdered, and Laurie may be the only one who can help him find the killer before they come for Evander next. Perhaps even more concerning is how the overgrown garden is refusing to stay behind its walls, slipping its vines and spores deeper into the house with each passing day. As the family’s dark secrets unravel alongside the growing horror of their terribly alive, bloodthirsty garden, Evander needs to find out what he’s really inheriting before the garden demands to be fed once more.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/u/UsedFeature4079&quot;&gt;/u/UsedFeature4079&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2nd Runner-Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Scammer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Tiffany D. Jackson&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Out from under her overprotective parents, Jordyn is ready to kill it in prelaw at a prestigious, historically Black university in Washington DC. When her new roommate’s brother is released from prison, the last thing Jordyn expects is to come home and find the ex-convict on their dorm room sofa. But Devonte needs a place to stay while he gets back on his feet—and how could she say no to one of her new best friends? Devonte is older, as charming as he is intelligent, pushing every student he meets to make better choices about their young lives. But Jordyn senses something sinister beneath his friendly advice and growing group of followers. When one of Jordyn’s roommates goes missing, she must enlist the help of the university’s lone white student to uncover the mystery—or become trapped at the center of a web of lies more tangled than she can imagine.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/u/No_Pen_6114&quot;&gt;/u/No_Pen_6114&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/r/books/comments/1plkuwn/best_romance_of_2025_voting_thread/&quot;&gt;Best Romance of 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Place&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Title&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Author&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Nominated&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Atmosphere&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Taylor Jenkins Reid&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Joan Goodwin has been obsessed with the stars for as long as she can remember. Thoughtful and reserved, Joan is content with her life as a professor of physics and astronomy at Rice University and as aunt to her precocious niece, Frances. That is, until she comes across an advertisement seeking the first women scientists to join NASA’s space shuttle program. Suddenly, Joan burns to be one of the few people to go to space. Selected from a pool of thousands of applicants in the summer of 1980, Joan begins training at Houston’s Johnson Space Center, alongside an exceptional group of fellow candidates: Top Gun pilot Hank Redmond and scientist John Griffin, who are kind and easygoing even when the stakes are highest; mission specialist Lydia Danes, who has worked too hard to play nice; warmhearted Donna Fitzgerald, who is navigating her own secrets; and Vanessa Ford, the magnetic and mysterious aeronautical engineer, who can fix any engine and fly any plane. As the new astronauts become unlikely friends and prepare for their first flights, Joan finds a passion and a love she never imagined. In this new light, Joan begins to question everything she thinks she knows about her place in the observable universe. Then, in December of 1984, on mission STS-LR9, it all changes in an instant.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/u/lesbrary&quot;&gt;/u/lesbrary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1st Runner-Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Everlasting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Alix E. Harrow&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Sir Una Everlasting was Dominion’s greatest hero: the orphaned girl who became a knight, who died for queen and country. Her legend lives on in songs and stories, in children’s books and recruiting posters―but her life as it truly happened has been forgotten. Centuries later, Owen Mallory―failed soldier, struggling scholar―falls in love with the tale of Una Everlasting. Her story takes him to war, to the archives―and then into the past itself. Una and Owen are tangled together in time, bound to retell the same story over and over again, no matter what it costs. But that story always ends the same way. If they want to rewrite Una’s legend―if they want to tell a different story--they’ll have to rewrite history itself.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/u/quinacridonerose&quot;&gt;/u/quinacridonerose&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2nd Runner-Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Favourites&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Layne Fargo&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;She might not have a famous name, funding, or her family’s support, but Katarina Shaw has always known that she was destined to become an Olympic skater. When she meets Heath Rocha, a lonely kid stuck in the foster care system, their instant connection makes them a formidable duo on the ice. Clinging to skating—and each other—to escape their turbulent lives, Kat and Heath go from childhood sweethearts to champion ice dancers, captivating the world with their scorching chemistry, rebellious style, and roller-coaster relationship. Until a shocking incident at the Olympic Games brings their partnership to a sudden end. As the ten-year anniversary of their final skate approaches, an unauthorized documentary reignites the public obsession with Shaw and Rocha, claiming to uncover the “real story” through interviews with their closest friends and fiercest rivals. Kat wants nothing to do with the documentary, but she can’t stand the thought of someone else defining her legacy. So, after a decade of silence, she’s telling her story: from the childhood tragedies that created her all-consuming bond with Heath to the clash of desires that tore them apart. Sensational rumors have haunted their every step for years, but the truth may be even more shocking than the headlines.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/u/CMCoFit&quot;&gt;/u/CMCoFit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/r/books/comments/1plkuwr/best_horror_of_2025_voting_thread/&quot;&gt;Best Horror of 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Place&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Title&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Author&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Nominated&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Buffalo Hunter Hunter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Stephen Graham Jones&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;This chilling historical novel is set in the nascent days of the state of Montana, following a Blackfeet Indian named Good Stab as he haunts the fields of the Blackfeet Nation looking for justice. It begins when a diary written in 1912 by a Lutheran pastor is discovered within a wall in 2012. What is unveiled is a slow massacre, a nearly forgotten chain of events that goes back to 217 Blackfeet dead in the snow, told in the transcribed interviews with Good Stab, who shares the narrative of his peculiar and unnaturally long life over a series of confessional visits.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/u/Ganzgly&quot;&gt;/u/Ganzgly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1st Runner-Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bat Eater and Other Names for Cora Zeng&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Kylie Lee Baker&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Cora Zeng is a crime scene cleaner, washing away the remains of brutal murders and suicides in Chinatown. The bloody messes don&amp;#39;t bother her, not when she&amp;#39;s already witnessed the most horrific thing possible: her sister being pushed in front of a train. Before fleeing the scene, the murderer whispered two words: bat eater. Months pass, the killer is never caught, and Cora can barely keep herself together. She pushes away all feelings, disregards the bite marks that appear on her coffee table, and won&amp;#39;t take her aunt&amp;#39;s advice to prepare for the Hungry Ghost Festival, when the gates of hell open. Cora tries to ignore the rising dread in her stomach, even when she and her weird co-workers begin finding bat carcasses at their crime scene clean-ups. But Cora can&amp;#39;t ignore the fact that all their recent clean-ups have been the bodies of East Asian women. Soon Cora will learn: you can&amp;#39;t just ignore hungry ghosts.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/u/No_Pen_6114&quot;&gt;/u/No_Pen_6114&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2nd Runner-Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;You Weren&amp;#39;t Meant to be Human&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Andrew Joseph White&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Festering masses of worms and flies have taken root in dark corners across Appalachia. In exchange for unwavering loyalty and fresh corpses, these hives offer a few struggling humans salvation. A fresh start. It’s an offer that none refuse. Crane is grateful. Among his hive’s followers, Crane has found a chance to transition, to never speak again, to live a life that won’t destroy him. He even met Levi: a handsome ex-Marine and brutal killer who treats him like a real man, mostly. But when Levi gets Crane pregnant—and the hive demands the child’s birth, no matter the cost—Crane’s desperation to make it stop will drive the community that saved him into a devastating spiral that can only end in blood.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/u/LiorahLights&quot;&gt;/u/LiorahLights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/r/books/comments/1plkuwy/best_nonfiction_of_2025_voting_thread/&quot;&gt;Best Nonfiction of 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Place&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Title&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Author&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Nominated&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;One Day, Everyone Will Have Always Been Against This&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Omar El Akkad&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;This book chronicles the deep fracture which has occurred for Black, brown, indigenous Americans, as well as the upcoming generation, many of whom had clung to a thread of faith in western ideals, in the idea that their countries, or the countries of their adoption, actually attempted to live up to the values they espouse. This book is a reckoning with what it means to live in the west, and what it means to live in a world run by a small group of countries—America, the UK, France and Germany. It will be The Fire Next Time for a generation that understands we’re undergoing a shift in the so-called ‘rules-based order,’ a generation that understands the west can no longer be trusted to police and guide the world, or its own cities and campuses. It draws on intimate details of Omar’s own story as an emigrant who grew up believing in the western project, who was catapulted into journalism by the rupture of 9/11.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/u/NoSmellNoTell&quot;&gt;/u/NoSmellNoTell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1st Runner-Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everything Is Tuberculosis: The History and Persistence of Our Deadliest Infection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;John Green&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;In 2019, author John Green met Henry Reider, a young tuberculosis patient at Lakka Government Hospital in Sierra Leone. John became fast friends with Henry, a boy with spindly legs and a big, goofy smile. In the years since that first visit to Lakka, Green has become a vocal advocate for increased access to treatment and wider awareness of the healthcare inequities that allow this curable, preventable infectious disease to also be the deadliest, killing over a million people every year. In Everything Is Tuberculosis, John tells Henry’s story, woven through with the scientific and social histories of how tuberculosis has shaped our world—and how our choices will shape the future of tuberculosis.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/u/moon-octopus&quot;&gt;/u/moon-octopus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2nd Runner-Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Sarah Wynn-Williams&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;From trips on private jets and encounters with world leaders to shocking accounts of misogyny and double standards behind the scenes, this searing memoir exposes both the personal and the political fallout when unfettered power and a rotten company culture take hold. In a gripping and often absurd narrative where a few people carelessly hold the world in their hands, this eye-opening memoir reveals what really goes on among the global elite. Sarah Wynn-Williams tells the wrenching but fun story of Facebook, mapping its rise from stumbling encounters with juntas to Mark Zuckerberg’s reaction when he learned of Facebook’s role in Trump’s election. She experiences the challenges and humiliations of working motherhood within a pressure cooker of a workplace, all while Sheryl Sandberg urges her and others to “lean in.”&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/u/betch_grylls&quot;&gt;/u/betch_grylls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/r/books/comments/1plkux4/best_translated_novel_of_2025_voting_thread/&quot;&gt;Best Translated Novel of 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Place&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Title&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Author&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Nominated&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Perfection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Vincenzo Latronico, Sophie Hughes (Translator)&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Millennial expat couple Anna and Tom are living the dream in Berlin, in a bright, plant-filled apartment in Neukölln. They are young digital creatives, freelancers without too many constraints. They have a passion for food, progressive politics, sexual experimentation and Berlin&amp;#39;s twenty-four-hour party scene. Their ideal existence is also that of an entire generation, lived out on Instagram, but outside the images they create for themselves, dissatisfaction and ennui burgeon. Their work as graphic designers becomes repetitive. Friends move back home, have children, grow up. An attempt at political activism during the refugee crisis proves fruitless. And in that picture-perfect life Anna and Tom feel increasingly trapped, yearning for an authenticity and a sense of purpose that seem perennially just out of their grasp.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/u/liza_lo&quot;&gt;/u/liza_lo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1st Runner-Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discontent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Beatriz Serrano, Mara Faye Lethem (Translator)&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;On the surface, Marisa&amp;#39;s life looks enviable. She lives in a beautiful apartment in the center of Madrid, she has a hot neighbor who is always around to sleep with her, and she’s rapidly risen through the ranks at an advertising agency. And yet she’s drowning in a dark hole of existential dread induced by the expectations of corporate life. Marisa hates her job and everyone at it. She spends her working hours locked in her office hiding from her coworkers, bingeing YouTube videos, and taking Valium. When she has the time, she escapes to her favorite museum where she contemplates the meaning of human life while staring at Hieronymus Bosch paintings, or trying to get hit by a car so she can go on disability. But Marisa&amp;#39;s success, which is largely built on lies and work she&amp;#39;s stolen from other people, is in danger of being unraveled when she&amp;#39;s forced to go on her company’s annual team-building retreat. Isolated in the Spanish mountains, surrounded by a psychopathic boss, overly enthusiastic co-workers who revel in their exploitation, a flirty retreat staff, and haunted by a deeply-buried memory about a past coworker, Marisa is pushed to the brink of a complete spiral.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/u/86rj&quot;&gt;/u/86rj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2nd Runner-Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the Calculation of Volume III&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Solvej Balle, Sophia Hersi Smith (translator), Jennifer Russell (Translator)&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Tara’s November 18th transforms when she discovers that she is no longer alone in her endless autumnal day. For she has met someone who remembers, and who knows as well as she does that “it is autumn, but that we’re not heading into winter. That spring and summer will not follow. That the reds and yellows of the trees are here to stay. That yesterday doesn’t mean the seventeenth of November, that tomorrow means the eighteenth, and that the nineteenth is a day we may never see.” Where Book I and II focused on a single woman’s involuntary journey away from her life and her loved ones and into the chasm of time, Book III brings us back into the realm of companionship, with all its thrills, odd quirks, and a sense of mutual bewilderment at having to relearn how to exist alongside others in a shared reality. And then of course, what of Tara’s husband Thomas, still sitting alone day after day, entirely unawares, in their house in Clarion-sous-Bois, waiting for his wife to return? Blending poetry and philosophical inquiry with rich reflections on our discombobulating times, Balle’s On the Calculation of Volume asks us to consider: What is a single person’s responsibility to humanity and to the preservation of this world?&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/u/mg132&quot;&gt;/u/mg132&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/r/books/comments/1plkuxc/best_book_cover_of_2025_voting_thread/&quot;&gt;Best Book Cover of 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Place&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Title&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Author&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Cover Artist&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Book Cover&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Nominated&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Water Moon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Samantha Sotto Yambao&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Haylee Morice&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images2.penguinrandomhouse.com/cover/9780593725016&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/u/Comprehensive-Fun47&quot;&gt;/u/Comprehensive-Fun47&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1st Runner-Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Katabasis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;R.F.

I just loved good comics and good books, and at some point people started liking what I wrote. Even now, I still think of myself more as an editor than a writer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s a moment Stephen King talks about where every reader eventually finishes a book, puts it down, and thinks: that was awful, I could do better than that. It’s a great moment. You start to see flaws. You reread writers you once admired and notice things you didn’t before. You even look back at your own early work and cringe a little.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But then there are the opposite experiences. Writers you read and immediately think: I will never be this good. For me, that was George R. R. Martin and Fredrik Backman. Their work didn’t discourage me, it raised the ceiling. It showed me what was possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That feeling is part of why I love science fiction, especially short stories by people like Arthur C. Clarke and Isaac Asimov. You read an idea you’ve never considered before, then have to stop, pause, and just think for a moment. That pause is my favourite part.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Which writers had that effect on you, the ones who made you want to start, or the ones who made you raise your standards?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/TwistedNeilio&quot;&gt; /u/TwistedNeilio &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1qh0hlb/the_writers_who_made_me_think_i_could_do_this_and/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1qh0hlb/the_writers_who_made_me_think_i_could_do_this_and/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_1qh0hlb</id><link href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1qh0hlb/the_writers_who_made_me_think_i_could_do_this_and/\" /><updated>2026-01-19T10:17:24+00:00</updated><published>2026-01-19T10:17:24+00:00</published><title>The writers who made me think “I could do this”… and the ones who made me think “I never will”</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/peaceembedded</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/peaceembedded</uri></author><category term=\"books\" label=\"r/books\"/><content type=\"html\">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book fortunately did not send me into an existential crisis. I think my favourite part of the book was the cult that was formed. Imagine you&amp;#39;re already in hell, the rules of this hell are clearly plastered on signs accessible to everyone, then someone tries to tell you &amp;#39;actually I was told we&amp;#39;re supposed to suffer more&amp;#39;. It just makes me think of this world we&amp;#39;re in. A world where we labour for 40+ hours a week to pay for basic necessities and we still get told there&amp;#39;s a hell after this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And I found it slightly humorous when people were &amp;#39;mourning&amp;#39; after a man had calculated the exact number of books in the library and its dimensions. It&amp;#39;s very reflective of a midlife crisis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;, this book shows that eternity itself is hell, even thinking about it feels like mental torture so I don&amp;#39;t even bother myself to try. I also felt a lot of familiarity reading this, as if revisiting thoughts I&amp;#39;ve already had.

I just can&amp;#39;t get enough of them. although I tend to avoid celebrity memoirs in favor of Memoirs that focus on Ordinary People or people who face extraordinary odds. you don&amp;#39;t have to say you love me by Sherman alexie has been one of my favorites in a long time for one particular reason. it is written in a very non-linear and disorganized manner. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;so many Memoirs tend to be written chronologically from when a person was born through their childhood and adversity into they became as an adult. it can sometimes feel a bit formulaic and sometimes a bit worn out. Sherman alexie&amp;#39;s memoir has like 80 chapters, or maybe it was 100, I can&amp;#39;t recall. some chapters are three or four sentences long, some chapters are poems, and all of them are various snapshots from entirely different time periods of his life and it was so fun and fascinating and made my ADHD brain happy. it kind of felt like if somebody took five or six journals they had written over their life tore all the pages out and Scattered them around a large room, and you end up collecting them all in a random order and making sense of the person&amp;#39;s life with each new page. I honestly wish more Memoirs were written this way, and I imagine it&amp;#39;s how I would want to write my own if I ever did. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;. full disclosure, I actually was not sure I was going to stick with this book and for the first hour or two of the audiobook I almost gave up but about 3 hours I got really hooked and was thoroughly engrossed the rest of the time&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/InvisibleAstronomer&quot;&gt; /u/InvisibleAstronomer &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1qhairr/i_have_read_five_or_six_memoirs_in_the_past_year/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1qhairr/i_have_read_five_or_six_memoirs_in_the_past_year/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_1qhairr</id><link href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1qhairr/i_have_read_five_or_six_memoirs_in_the_past_year/\" /><updated>2026-01-19T17:26:28+00:00</updated><published>2026-01-19T17:26:28+00:00</published><title>I have read five or six Memoirs in the past year, and there is one reason You don't Have to say You Love Me by Sherman Alexie stands out</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/Lil_Brown_Bat</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/Lil_Brown_Bat</uri></author><category term=\"books\" label=\"r/books\"/><content type=\"html\">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently reading Wuthering Heights for the first time, and I&amp;#39;m having trouble getting through Joseph&amp;#39;s dialogue because of the dialect.

This has been something that has been said time and time again in different ways, but nevertheless is still a true sentiment and a tool that is used very often, especially amongst political figures, as their justification for eroding the rights and liberties of the citizens. Communism was the common enemy of the world during the first two Red Scare Periods and during those two periods, it was used as a justification for widespread human rights abuses and violations. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese were the common enemy, which led to their internment at the hands of the Roosevelt administration, with many of their lives being uprooted permanently. For Rodrigo Duterte, the former President of the Philippines, his common enemy was drug dealers and addicts. During his reign over the country, he waged a war on them, vowing to kill them and wipe them out to save his country from them, as well as the corrupt politicians he said were helping them. It was this period that saw widespread violations of both human and civil rights. Some People Need Killing is an examination of that war and its effects, but it is also a critique of the people who allowed it to happen and joined in on the war, much to the detriment of even their own family members. It is an examination of our carceral society and the belief in mob justice for those society deems the most incorrigible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some People Need Killing is the best book that I read in the year 2025, and that is because not only is it an informative account of Filipino history, but it is also a testimony of the very angry sides of society. In the book, Patricia Evangelista makes it very clear that the book pulls no punches because she is, in the book and in life, a trauma journalist. She reports on the trauma that things cause people such as when she describes the effects of the natural disasters and seeing the pain that people experienced after. As a trauma journalist, she is reporting on the hardship that these people experience following very large events. In this book, while she is very clear on her anti-Duterte stance, it does not take away from the clear trauma that the policies of someone like Duterte caused for people. She also does this for former presidents like Aquino, who showed little to no regard for the victims of the hurricane and showed an ignorance that caused people to turn against him heavily. But when she starts talking about Duterte and his effect, it is very different, and let me explain why.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So in the introduction to this post, I said that we live in a carceral society, so I first have to say what that means. A carceral society is when things are adjacent or like a prison. In these societies, punishment is placed over rehabilitation or redemption. I first came across this concept in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3U20CRp_4k&amp;amp;t=4s&quot;&gt;excellent video&lt;/a&gt; by the YouTuber Shanspeare. This quote really takes the cake:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;Rachel Zegler&amp;#39;s hate campaign is part of an ever-moving and violently popular environment where women are targeted by droves of individuals and institutions. In the beginning, these attacks are disguised as criticism, but ultimately lack construction. These comments don&amp;#39;t facilitate change or accountability on the part of the targeted woman. It just breeds fear and defeat. That&amp;#39;s the point. These hate campaigns are not done out of a desire to see someone become better or be held accountable. That&amp;#39;s one way we know that they are influenced by our carceral culture. The point isn&amp;#39;t restorative justice or rehabilitation. The point is to dehumanize and dispose of people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Carceral society hinges on this idea that the downtrodden or the rejects of society need to be disposed of, and the mob will take care of that for them. Duterte is someone who got the mob to engage in the bloodlust by giving them a good enemy. Drug addicts and dealers were made the enemy of the people. This book is very brutal, and that is on purpose. If this book weren&amp;#39;t as vivid as it was with its imagery, the message would be lost. The damaging effects of what happened and the trauma it caused the country would be lost so it needs to put an up close and personal look to the stories. By doing this, it creates a very human look at the people who were affected by this, and that is something that the government did not do when they enacted this &amp;quot;war&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Listening to how Pat describes her job in this book is something that would send chills up the spine of just about anyone who does not work in her industry:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;My job is to go to places where people die. I pack my bags, talk to the survivors, write my stories, then go home to wait for the next catastrophe. I don&amp;#39;t wait very long.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And to see where the quote comes from, it is not hard to see why this book is a very heavy read. It comes from a vigilante who was responsible for the deaths of quite a few people. In the carceral society, this is a very common sentiment:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m really not a bad guy,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not all bad. Some people need killing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a sentiment that many people get behind, depending on who the people are that supposedly need killing. In this book, not only did the government get in on this &amp;quot;war&amp;quot;, but society also got involved actively. Pat made sure to include several testimonials from people who reported their own family members and actively campaigned for the war, believing it to be a good thing, now that they have found what is tearing apart society and their families. It presents a first-person side of things from real-life experiences.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book calls out society for some of the more morbid ideas that can and have become more prevalent. It was written in 2023; however, as we say a lot, this book has many points that are relevant to this day. I suggest getting a copy, or if you are someone who prefers it, there is an audiobook on Spotify that is narrated by the author. This book is definitely the best book that I read in 2025.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/Longjumping_Gain_807&quot;&gt; /u/Longjumping_Gain_807 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1qge2n8/some_people_need_killing_mob_justice_and_societal/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1qge2n8/some_people_need_killing_mob_justice_and_societal/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_1qge2n8</id><link href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1qge2n8/some_people_need_killing_mob_justice_and_societal/\" /><updated>2026-01-18T17:08:16+00:00</updated><published>2026-01-18T17:08:16+00:00</published><title>Some People Need Killing: Mob Justice and Societal Bloodlust</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/Reddit_Books</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/Reddit_Books</uri></author><category term=\"books\" label=\"r/books\"/><content type=\"html\">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello readers!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every Monday, we will post a calendar with the date and topic of that week&amp;#39;s threads and we will update it to include links as those threads go live.

I enjoyed the whole process (both the reading and reviewing) so I thought I’d do it again this year, with modern fantasy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While I’m not a complete newcomer to fantasy, I mostly only read the big series (LotR, ASoIaF, WoT, Witcher, HP etc.), and not much of modern fantasy, so I wanted to explore how the genre is progressing in the new millennium. I considered any series that started after 2000 to be modern fantasy, which might not be the best categorization, but that’s where I drew the line.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wasn’t able to read as much as last year, but still managed to read 22 books from 12 series. There are a couple of big misses, and believe me, there were like 10 other series on my list that I just couldn’t make time for – but hey, at least, I’ll not run out of reading material any time soon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ll try to avoid spoilers; however, I consider a book’s main premise and plot points that could be on the back cover fair game - so if you want to go into these books completely blind, don’t read further. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So here are my reviews (in reading order): &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourth Wing (Rebecca Yarros)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This book is a mess. But a fun one! I accidentally started my fantasy year with Fourth Wing (didn’t yet know that I’ll do a modern fantasy year) after my wife got it for Christmas last year, and it looked like a solid fantasy from the cover. As I wanted something different after all the sci-fi of the year before, I went in completely blind. I didn’t even know about the romantasy genre before, and I thought this would be something like an Eragon-esque easy fantasy. Imagine my surprise when the book turned out to be 50% lusting after male bodies with the other 50% being some random fantasy setting with so many plot holes that you wonder if there’s actually a plot between the 14-page long sex scenes. So how is it fun? Well, it’s just easy to read, and you can quickly get on board after you realize during the first few chapters that there isn’t that much to pay attention to, and you can just cruise along the story. The book also doesn’t pretend to be more serious than it is, so you can just lean back and read what technically can be called a story, but mostly you’ll read how amazing Xanden’s body is. By the way, I’m not being sarcastic, I did have fun reading it – it’s actually interesting what no expectations does to the enjoyment of a story. But during it I was also really hoping that this isn’t what modern fantasy has grown into. &lt;strong&gt;6/10&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Kingkiller Chronicle (Patrick Rothfuss)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Luckily, I picked up the Kingkiller Chronicle right after Fourth Wing, and it proved right away that modern fantasy can be good, or great even. Despite the series not being perfect (not the least because it’s not finished), it’s just written so well that it’s easy to overlook its flaws. The prose is great, the narrative is fascinating and the challenges our protagonist faces are dynamic and well-paced. I was thoroughly entertained while reading it. However, the further I’m from the actual reading experience, the more the flaws become apparent. For example, the protagonist is the biggest Gary Stu I’ve ever read (I know he’s an unreliable narrator, but you can’t be world-class at magic, music, sex and eastern martial arts at the same time), he is super white-knighty and the story, while posing many fascinating mysteries, doesn’t seem to have actual answers to them. But as I said, I didn’t sense much of this while reading the book, so I might be a little bit too critical due to the time passed. It’s still a great read, just don’t think about it too hard afterwards :) &lt;strong&gt;8/10&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Name of the Wind&lt;/strong&gt; encompasses everything that works great about the series – the story is well-paced, the proposed mysteries are intriguing, the framing story is done really well and the narrative still feels on track. Yes, the above-mentioned issues are already there, but the good parts overwhelm them, making this book a very enjoyable read. &lt;strong&gt;8.5/10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Wise Man&amp;#39;s Fear&lt;/strong&gt; is where the story kind of starts moving in circles. When I was almost done with the first half of the book, and we were still at the magic school, I knew there was no way the plot could advance at a pace that it needed to get at least some progress on the mysteries and the main plot. And this became even more apparent as the second half of the book starts to feel like a series of independent adventures with the same protagonist – each interesting in their own way, but not really being parts of a cohesive narrative. Still, it’s an enjoyable book, and I really hope that eventually we’ll get the third one and get some closure on the story. &lt;strong&gt;7.5/10&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Slow Regard of Silent Things&lt;/strong&gt; is a novella based around one of the side characters in the series and is written very differently than the main books. It’s a classical case of an author experimenting with different styles – Rothfuss admits as much in the foreword – and I get what he’s going for, I just didn’t enjoy it that much. It was an interesting reading experience, but I felt like there wasn’t much substance besides the unique mindset (or mental illness) of the protagonist. &lt;strong&gt;6.5/10&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The First Law Trilogy (Joe Abercrombie)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The First Law Trilogy is actually really just one big book, separated into three smaller, but still big ones, and with the author leaning heavily into the three-act structure, the three books cleanly become the three acts. Now this has its pros and cons. The con is mainly suffered by the first book, where it takes sooo much time to get things going and pull our characters together, but after you get through it, the second book quickly starts to repay your investment as you get more into the story and the characters, and the third book becomes one of the most epic conclusions I’ve read this year. Also, speaking of characters, this is where Abercrombie shines the most. The story (for me) was nothing special, but the characters are extremely complex and well written. It’s rare when the same characters can act completely differently between two situations and still be believable, but Abercrombie nails these changes and he shows how societal setting and group pressure influence even what seem to be core personality traits – I’ve never felt more validated for having different personalities for different friend groups! Also Glokta is probably in the top 5 fantasy characters of all time. So to sum it up, it’s a great read, after you get through book (or act) 1. &lt;strong&gt;8.5/10&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;As mentioned, &lt;strong&gt;The Blade Itself&lt;/strong&gt; isn’t a great standalone book. I found myself asking multiple times ‘Why am I reading about these people?’ throughout the book, as our main characters seemingly don’t have any connection to each other or any impact on the world. And sure, by the end of the book it all comes together, and you realize that this 500-page book was just a prelude to the actual story. And looking back, everything kind of falls into place, but it’s a bit of a struggle as a first-time reader. However, it does a lot of groundwork for the characters and the world for the next books, so I can’t be too mad at it. &lt;strong&gt;7/10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Before They Are Hanged&lt;/strong&gt; the story finally takes off for real. Our characters begin to interact with each other and their dynamic is great. Some plots are still separated and there’s a weird choice to have half of the POV characters in the same group throughout the book, and in the least interesting storyline which thus takes up a lot of space that could’ve been spent elsewhere. But regardless, the characters really start to shine through the pages, and so I started to understand why this series is so recommended. &lt;strong&gt;8/10&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last Argument of Kings&lt;/strong&gt; concludes the series in an epic fashion – and it’s easy to do so as the first two books really built up everything that was needed for it. I found the ending for each character perfect – not the ending I would’ve liked for the character, but the ending they needed to have based on everything that came before. In the end there’s one storyline I didn’t like – the magic one with Bayaz – as I felt it took away from the groundedness of the others. But everything else was great, and this book can be held up as a prime example of how to finish a series. &lt;strong&gt;9/10&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Served Cold (Joe Abercrombie)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt; While not a direct sequel to the First Law trilogy, Best Served Cold clearly continues down the grimdark road of the first books. Brandon Sanderson defined grimdark as a story where “each and every good deed is punished”, and this has never been more true than in Best Served Cold. Anytime a character does something even mildly nice, they are severely punished for it after – and to be honest this becomes a little predictable as the story goes on. However, the more focused plot allows a smoother and more streamlined reading experience, where the narrative is clear, the stakes are clear and our characters can shine from the beginning. There’s a noticeable shift towards a more stylized dialogue (and there is a lot of dialogue), with the style of gangster movies (from the likes of Guy Ritchie and Tarantino) serving as a clear inspiration. For me, this stylized prose has become a little bit much by the end (after all we’re talking about a 680-page book, not a 2-hour movie), but it might be that I’ve read too much Abercrombie in one go. So after this, I’ve kept the First Law books on hold for the rest of the year, but I’ll probably return to them in a year or two. &lt;strong&gt;7.5/10&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Powder Mage (Brian McClellan)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt; I’m a little ambivalent (though leaning positive) about these books. First, this series has the most original magic system I’ve read all year and it’s integrated perfectly into the American/French revolution aesthetic, and these really provide the series with a strong backbone. But (and here comes the big &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt;) I can’t for the life of me understand why the author felt the need to introduce a different, super generic classical fantasy magic system into the story, and also why, oh why do we need to have gods in this universe. There are so many stories about fireball-throwing, lightning-shooting, ice-summoning magi that aim to prevent/bring forward the summoning of a god (isn’t this the plot of every second World of Warcraft raid?) that it’s just super played out for me. Maybe it’s just me, but I feel like these additions really take away from the strongest aspects (setting and the powder magic) of the books. The other elements of the book are well written, the story is sound, most of the characters are interesting (especially Tamas), however they’re just that – well written, not extraordinary. &lt;strong&gt;7.5/10&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promise of Blood&lt;/strong&gt; starts the series strongly with an ongoing coup, which gives it a nice dynamic to the first part of the book. This, and all similar political intrigue plots are the best part of the story. However, we soon leave this behind as we have our – otherwise likable – investigator character going after some prophecy bullsh*t. I think I made it clear above how I feel about this, but nevertheless, it’s a fine first entry of the series, even if I had problems with parts of the plot. &lt;strong&gt;7/10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Crimson Campaign&lt;/strong&gt; is the best entry in the series – coincidentally the one with the least generic fantasy plots – I especially enjoyed the death march behind enemy lines, where it constantly felt like the characters were on their last legs, but still, their solutions (mostly) didn’t feel forced or convenient. At one point, however, I had to realize I didn’t really care for Taniel (who is one of the main characters), which sucks as he had some interesting plotlines, but his personality is just not very likable. &lt;strong&gt;8/10&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Aaaaand we’re back with the god stuff in &lt;strong&gt;The Autumn Republic&lt;/strong&gt;. I know, even I’m bored of my complaints by now, but what can I do? It just bugs me about these books. We get another god, and his deal is… election campaigns and trade unions. I mean, at this point, what’s the point of him being a god? I really like all the political plots and maneuvering, but the sharp contrast between the groundedness of the story and the fantasy elements really bothered me right to the end. But besides this, the ending is a competent and satisfying way to conclude the series, which after all, I’m glad I’ve read. &lt;strong&gt;7.5/10&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Darker Shade of Magic (V. E. Schwab)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This book has so much wasted potential. I was hooked on the world as soon as I read the synopsis – four parallel Londons, that are similar, but are shaped by different events into becoming separate worlds – how cool is that? I couldn’t wait for the author to highlight the comparisons between each world and show how they are alike, but not alike at the same time. However, it turns out my expectations were way too high. Instead of exciting alternative Londons we got Boring (Real) London, Generic Good London, Generic Evil London and Generic Extra Evil London. The only parallels between them are that there’s one(!) building in the exact same place in each and there’s a Thames in all of them. So not very exciting. But how about the characters, the story? Those were to me kind of average – there wasn’t anything wrong with them per se, but I just couldn’t really get involved. One problem I had is that there’s a lot of ‘tell, don’t show’, for example, we are told again and again how our protagonist loves his brother, and this even becomes a key plot point down the line. However, the only interaction we see between them before things go down is when they argue with each other – we don’t see them having fun or hanging out or anything, and this really hampers the impact of the later parts of the book. There are other examples of this, so in the end this book didn’t really grab me, so I didn’t read further into the series. &lt;strong&gt;6/10&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Green Bone Saga (Fonda Lee)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The Green Bone Saga is the best series I’ve read this year. Its setting (a fantasy world that’s parallel to our 1970s East Asia) and themes are completely unique in this genre and Fonda Lee handles these magnificently. She tackles topics like how globalization affects traditional societies, how immigrant groups try to hold on to their native culture, while trying to adhere to the norms of the country they’re in, how honor-based rules and traditions collide with what’s essentially becoming a modernized world and other difficult topics that are usually absent in fantasy literature. All of these are presented as real challenges for the characters, without falling into the evil globalization vs. morally pure native dichotomy – in which it helps that our protagonists are organized criminals. This is also handled wonderfully as the characters are nuanced, flawed, but still very human and understandable, or even likable. I didn’t give a perfect score to any of the books as the first one lacks the ambitious themes of the whole series, while the latter two’s story is less focused due to the growing scope. However, in total it really is greater than the sum of its parts, so as a series it gets a perfect &lt;strong&gt;10/10&lt;/strong&gt; from me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jade City&lt;/strong&gt; is the most focused and dynamic story out of the three books (the story happens in just 6 months, instead of the years the following books tackle), and it pulls the reader right in. The living, breathing city of Janloon provides a wonderful backdrop to the great characters whose unique struggles and challenges are super captivating. The author doesn’t hold any punches, the stakes are real and high. The book lacks the thematical depth of the rest of the series, but it’s a near-perfect story on its own as well. &lt;strong&gt;9/10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jade War&lt;/strong&gt; starts to broaden the story with more perspectives. We meet immigrant communities, our characters start to feel the grasps of globalization and how super-powers influence and vie over resource-rich, but smaller countries. And these are just the background themes behind a good-old clan war. However, to show all this, the story becomes less focused and a little bit too broad, but it’s all worth it in the end. &lt;strong&gt;8.5/10&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;With &lt;strong&gt;Jade Legacy&lt;/strong&gt; we’re moving into modernity, and with it, the changing of traditional values, generational differences and the societal volatility that is caused by all these drive the story forward. The story is even less focused – it takes place over 20 years -, so there are places where I was not yet ready for the time-jumps and wanted to read more about certain situations, but I accept that to tackle these themes, these were unavoidable. The conclusion is handled extremely well, it’s perfectly bittersweet and rounds out a great reading experience in total. &lt;strong&gt;8.5/10&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Lies of Locke Lamora (Scott Lynch)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The Lies of Locke Lamora is a fine book with likable characters and a well-written story. However, the flow of the book really threw me off. We’d start a heist in the present, then flashback to a storyline from 10 years ago then have a flashback &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; the flashback. Then back to the present story. Then flashback again. And this goes on throughout the book. Maybe it would’ve been fine, if the glimpses to the past were interesting at least, but I found most of them quite boring, especially as I couldn’t wait to get on with the main story. But no, we had to see what irrelevant things happened to our characters 10 years ago (so a secondary character pretended to be a priest for a while, thanks, now can we go back to the literal climax of the book?). But at least the main story was interesting, and the characters were great as well. I especially liked that the author didn’t hold any punches, and there were real stakes and consequences. But in the end, I couldn’t really get over the flow and structure of the story, and while I liked the book at a lot of places, I don’t think I’ll continue with the series. &lt;strong&gt;7/10&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bloodsworn Saga (John Gwynne)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Surprisingly, I haven’t yet encountered many fantasy books that are based on Nordic culture. It’s surprising as it lends itself super well to the genre as it’s showcased by the Bloodsworn Saga. It’s just familiar enough so that concepts don’t have to be over-explained and unusual enough so it’s not just another fantasy world that’s basically medieval Europe. So the setting is great, the worldbuilding is solid, but the story has some issues. Nothing to ruin the experience, and I enjoyed the books and the story, but it won’t be a 10/10. And although I didn’t have time to read the third book this year (it was already November when I finished the second book and I wanted to dig into a few more series), I’m definitely picking it up next year, as I’m quite interested in how the story ends. &lt;strong&gt;7.5/10&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;I imagine &lt;strong&gt;The Shadow of the Gods&lt;/strong&gt; was written like this: the author wrote a very solid story, then said ‘Hey, this is a pretty good, let’s duplicate everything, it’ll be twice as good!’. And behold: there are 2 very similar mercenary groups, 2 moms looking for their kidnapped kids, 2 &lt;span class=&quot;md-spoiler-text&quot;&gt;protagonists with wolf powers&lt;/span&gt;, 2 &lt;span class=&quot;md-spoiler-text&quot;&gt;groups going north to explore sites of fallen gods&lt;/span&gt;, and I could go on. The two very similar mercenary groups are my biggest gripe, as several times I had to stop and think about which character is part of which one. But besides this, as I said, it’s a pretty good story, action-packed and dynamic. The characters are solid, not necessarily complicated, but there are a couple of twists about them that make them interesting. &lt;strong&gt;7.5/10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Hunger of the Gods&lt;/strong&gt; picks up where the previous book finished, the dynamism and action continues, but this time it got a little too much for me. Basically what happens is that the 3 original characters go from place to place and kill everything in-between. Lots of broken skulls, slit up bellies, and cut-off appendages. It gets a little tiresome after a while and by the end I found myself skimming over the battle scenes, as after a point they all seemed the same. The actionmovie-esque writing also introduces some weird things, like super short chapters (there’s a chapter that’s just 2 pages long), that I imagine should evoke the effect of a camera cutting back-and-forth between two characters, but it just didn’t work for me that much. What did work for me are the parts that are NOT filled with gore and violence and chopped off fingers: there are a couple of new characters whose story is not as action-packed and they slow the narrative down nicely and we’re shown some nice character development, intrigue and much-needed breathing space between the other chapters. &lt;strong&gt;7/10&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Poppy War (R. F. Kuang)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This is a weird one. While The Poppy War does a lot of things well – showing how seemingly “meritocratic” systems can entrench the power of the ruling class, providing a perspective into women’s challenges in highly competitive environments etc. –, but there are just so many things wrong with the book that I just couldn’t enjoy it in the end. First, the prose is clunky in a lot of places, e.g. it sometimes goes from third-person limited to third-person omniscient point-of-view within the same chapter. Then the worldbuilding is really unimaginative: it’s just China, that’s it, with some magic (plus Japan and the Western countries). For example, quotes in the book in-story are from real Chinese philosophers with their actual name included, which is quite jarring. If the author wanted to do an alternative mystical version of China, why create a seemingly new fantasy world, that just comes off as lazy worldbuilding? Lastly, the tone of the book is extremely inconsistent. One chapter I’m worrying about the story turning into a YA-style love triangle, and the (literally) next chapter describes some of the most extreme, horrendous atrocities I’ve ever read in ANY book. This last part is so insanely out-of-place, unexpected and unwanted that I considered not finishing the book. I powered through, but I most certainly won’t read the rest of the series and I might just keep away from all future books of the author. &lt;strong&gt;5.5/10&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Piranesi (Susanna Clarke)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This was a great read! Piranesi is a unique take on the “infinite house” trope, where the mystery is captivating, and the plot is excellently written. Many mysteries fail to involve the reader in the solution, making it impossible to come to the right conclusion on our own (I’m looking at you &lt;em&gt;literally every detective book ever&lt;/em&gt;), but not Piranesi. Here, when a new clue was introduced, I was able to figure it out maybe a page or two before the protagonist came to his conclusions. I also didn’t have to “wait” for him over chapters to figure out something obvious. This shows how well-written and well-paced the story is. My only criticism would be that the ending was a little too neat (but this is a matter of taste) and that I would have liked an additional ~100 pages of non-plot-heavy exploration of the House that could’ve let the story breathe a little more, especially in the later chapters. &lt;strong&gt;9/10&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Fifth Season (N. K. Jemisin)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt; I enjoyed The Fifth Season thoroughly. It’s interesting in more ways than one, the plot is solid, the characters are great and the world is fascinating. I also liked how it went against some usual trends and e.g. used a second-person narrative in a few chapters – it’s clear that the author didn’t just follow formulas, but went in her own direction. The worldbuilding is also not just the usual “medieval equivalent of our world with magic” that a lot of fantasy books fall into, it’s a well thought-out, convincing world, where people aren’t based on a particular “real” civilization, but rather their culture corresponds to the challenges and problems that are in their own lives and world. Sadly, I didn’t have time to read the rest of the series in 2025, but I’ll certainly start 2026 with the next book. &lt;strong&gt;9/10&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Curse of Chalion (Lois McMaster Bujold)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The final book of my modern fantasy year turned out to be not a modern fantasy, but a very much classical one. Even though it was released after my arbitrary deadline of 2000, the contrast between this book and the others I’ve read are stark: the morally grey protagonists are nowhere to be seen, here the good characters are good, the bad ones are bad; the good princess is beautiful and she marries the brave prince; the gods are kind and try to help the mortals against the evil of the world. If I’m being completely honest, it was a bit of fresh air after all the complicated themes, ambiguous motivations and uncomfortable stories. So this review and score might be a little inflated by this, but I really enjoyed The Curse of Chalion. The story flowed smoothly, the challenges were substantial, but not unconquerable, the good characters were likable, the bad ones were appropriately dislikable and the whole narrative was built up and then closed in a satisfying way. Of course, I didn’t gain any new perspective, neither was I surprised by anything that happened, but this is definitely a solid book to read, and I’m glad I finished my year with this one. &lt;strong&gt;8/10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/trollokvoltak&quot;&gt; /u/trollokvoltak &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1qfcnqk/ive_spent_2025_reading_modern_fantasy_here_are/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1qfcnqk/ive_spent_2025_reading_modern_fantasy_here_are/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_1qfcnqk</id><link href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1qfcnqk/ive_spent_2025_reading_modern_fantasy_here_are/\" /><updated>2026-01-17T13:01:47+00:00</updated><published>2026-01-17T13:01:47+00:00</published><title>I've spent 2025 reading modern fantasy - here are some reviews</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/Tsweet7</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/Tsweet7</uri></author><category term=\"books\" label=\"r/books\"/><content type=\"html\">&lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1qf22lh/alabama_library_denied_funding_because_it_wont/&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://external-preview.redd.it/W0TsWmym9mIhqmlVCv-_cKyP2DfjdNQX0Fbpp-oNgrY.jpeg?width=640&amp;amp;crop=smart&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=99e5739826ddf45fbf71268ac727da7ac918a343&quot; alt=&quot;Alabama library denied funding because it won’t move classic book ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’&quot; title=&quot;Alabama library denied funding because it won’t move classic book ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone who commented on the original post.
